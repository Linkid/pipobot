This directory contains two scripts to simplify the translation of the application.

translation.sh: 
It takes as argument the language code (fr_FR, en_US for instance).
It parses all the code of the project, extracting all _("  ") text, and generates au 'language'.po file.
Then you can edit this file to translate the application.
If a file 'language'.po already exists, it will be updated.

compile.sh:
Once 'language'.po file has been completed, this script will generate the .mo corresponding file
and will put it in the 'locale' directory of the application.
